# School_District_Analysis
Analyzing school district data

## Overview: 
The school board was notified that the reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered showing evidence of academic dishonesty. In order to uphold state-testing standards, this project has replaced the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. The school district analysis was then repeated with the updated data set. The following analysis describes the results and how the replacement of Thomas High School 9th graders scores with NaNs affected the overall school distric analysis.
